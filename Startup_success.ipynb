Let's now quickly go over the list and see if it makes sense to keep these features.\n\n- **'Employees count MoM change'** makes nearly the half of the dataset drop, so let's just get rid of that feature, as I don't even know what MoM is (Ministry of Manpower?).\n- **'Employee Count'** who doesn't have this record? It seems like such a  primitive question! Anyways, this is an important data, and, sadly, we have to drop 166 lines!\n- **'Last Funding Amount'** let's just drop this column.\n- **'Investors'** this one is different, my intuition is that the rows that don't have investors have NaN values, so instead of dropping them, I'm going to substitute those with empty strings. Later, when I will make this variable binary, those rows will just have 0s for all the Investors. \n- **'Industry of company'** is pretty important in my opinion, so I'm going to drop the rows that have NaN.\n- **'Specialization of highest education'** is a crazy field: some have meaningful answers and some have things like _\"PhD\"_ or _\"INDUSTRI\"_ or _\"computers\"_. Plus, this field is not directly connected to the success, in my opinion, the connection between the field of the startup and the specialization is what matters. We could filter all the fields out from specialization in complex ways and then compare with the fields of the startup, but if we take a quick look at the dataset, we'll see that the answers vary a lot and maybe it's best in this case to just discard this column and not over-engineer.\n- The rest are fairly important and don't have drastic results, so we'll just drom the NaN rows."
